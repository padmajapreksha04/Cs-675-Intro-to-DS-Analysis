# Overview
This project Perform Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customer Churn data within the Telecommunication industry. The goal of this project is to understand the logic and methods of exploratory data analysis (EDA). The mode of analysis is concerned with discovery, exploration, and empirically detecting phenomena in data.

# Dataset
The dataset telco-customer-churn.csv- contains the customer information that has 7043 rows and 21 columns. There are 17 categorical features, 3 numerical features, and one prediction feature.

# Tools and Technologies
Python (for data analysis, cleaning, and visualization0

Libraries
1) Utilizing the classic (legacy) EDA libraries: NumPy, Pandas, graph libraries 
(MatPlotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), and Python’s Statsmodel modules for interactive data analysis and documentation)
2) Generating ‘html’ reports by integrating Pandas Profiling and SweetViz Python libraries.
